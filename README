Usage:

scp binary to /config directory in your unit’s controller…this is the only directly that gets saved on reboot on antminers

binary accepts two inputs in the format of:

./set_voltage [chain# 1-4] [voltage in hex]

bitmains voltage controller can be configured to change the 12v input roughly +/- 1v from 10v, and this is configurable via a hex range of 0x00-0xfe, with the default being set to the middle (0x80). Higher hex values (0x80-0xfe) will LOWER voltage, lower values (0x00-0x7f) will INCREASE voltage from the default. 

For example if you want to slightly decrease your voltage on chain #1 you would input:

./set_voltage 1 90

increments of 0x10 are good starting point to test a sweet spot for each board for a particular frequency. Lowering voltage until you get around 1 HW error per minute is usually a good reference “sweet spot”
